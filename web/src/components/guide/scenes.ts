// The script. Each scene is a band of the page; each step is one block of
// copy inside it, and the step whose block crosses the middle of the viewport
// is the one on stage. The page (GuideExperience) renders the copy and the
// DOM motion, the stage (GuideCanvas) reads the step here and moves the
// device, the camera and the effects to match.
//
// Knobs are logical: 0..3 = K1..K4, as the device numbers them.
//
// The guide is three guides (pages.ts), each with its own script. SCENES is
// Play (/guide/play, 01–04) and BUILD_SCENES (scenes/build.ts) is Build
// (/guide/build): both are played by the 3D stage. MAKE_SCENES is Make
// (/guide/make, 01–02), whose chapters are in scenes/ and whose stage is the
// desk of app windows (desk/DeskStage.tsx) — its steps say which windows are
// on the desk (DeskStep), not what a device does. Every guide opens on a
// scene called "opening" and ends on one called "next"; which guide's is
// meant is the store's `page`. The hub (/guide, GuideHub) has the stage too,
// playing HUB_SCENES: Play's opening, and nothing after it.
