// Build (/guide/build) — every word of the guide, in both languages: for
// someone who solders a Patternflow from bare parts. Its title for search and
// sharing, the opening, the chapters, the end, and the words on the cards
// inside its steps (build/BuildCards.tsx). The chapters line up with
// scenes/build.ts by id, and their steps one-to-one (pages.test.ts checks
// both). The small print every guide shares — "Stuck here?" — is copy.ts's
// `ui`.
//
// The written sources are the truth: BUILD_GUIDE.md (the v3.9 board), the BOM
// (hardware/bom/bom_v3.9.csv), hardware/**/README.md. The parts list on the
// page is the CSV itself (build/bom.ts); what is here is only what a card
// says about a line, keyed by its reference (build/build.test.ts checks every
// line has one). The list is made to be scanned: a quantity, a part, its
// reference and a few words. What to order it by, alternates and sourcing
// notes are behind the line, or left to the file and BUILD_GUIDE §1, which
// the card links. One line says more, because it is the one that goes wrong:
// the LED panel, with the listing BUILD_GUIDE §1 recommends and the way to
// docs/panel-compatibility.md. The board's known issues are BUILD_GUIDE.md
// §10: link there, don't restate them. The board has one power input, J4, the
// screw terminal: USB-C is never power. Firmware is the Play guide's 01 Flash,
// not repeated here. There are no kits.
//
// No multimeter, anywhere: the maker cut the short check, the continuity
// check and the 5 V measurement as steps nobody needs. After the wiring the
// build goes straight on to the firmware, the DevKit and first light; what a
// builder checks before power is what they can see, the +5v marks
// (build/build.test.ts keeps the meter out).
//
// The LED panel goes into the frame from the FRONT and stops on the twelve
// tabs inside it. The tabs are part of the frame (encloser.stl's frame halves,
// the .blend's 0904_v3.9 body; docs/build-guide/images/v3/02, 11–13), and the
// M4 screws go in from behind, through the tabs, into the panel's own
// threads. Only for_other_panels/ has a separate mounting part.
//
// The board's two faces are "the printed side" (all its lettering, the
// sockets, J1, J3, J4 and C11 — KiCad's F side) and "the plain side" (where
// the encoders' bodies sit). Not "front" and "back": the docs use "back" for
// both the encoder side and J4's, which are opposite faces.
//
// The two covers are named as the Play guide names them, because a builder
// is sent into its 01 Flash mid-build: "the back panel" is the big snap-fit
// plate, "the back cover" the small one that slides over the board.
