// The hub's words (/guide, GuideHub): where the reader picks a guide by

// each, the one line a reader recognises themselves in. Each guide's name
// and its chapter names come from the guide itself (pages.ts); what the
// guide covers is the guide's own opening to say, not the hub's. The brand,
// the WIP chip and the language switch are copy.ts's.

// Build is for someone soldering a Patternflow from bare parts — starting
// with nothing: its first chapters are buying the parts, ordering the board
// and printing the case, so its line must not say the parts are already on
// the bench. There are no kits and no assembled boards: never offer one.
